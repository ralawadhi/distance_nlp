This is a practice project for another project I am thinking of working on.
I make use of the nltk library to calculate the lexical distance between a set if languages. Each language has a corresponding Swadesh list composed of 208 words. I also use networkx and Graphviz modules to make a graph based on the computed distances between the langauges.
